		<h4 class="subTopic">1. Initiation</h4>
		<p>
			First, you need to identify a business need, problem, or opportunity and brainstorm ways that your team can meet this need, solve this problem, or seize this opportunity. During this step, you figure out an objective for your project, determine whether the project is feasible, and identify the major deliverables for the project.

			Project management steps for the initiation phase
			Steps for the project initiation phase may include the following:

			Undertaking a feasibility study: Identify the primary problem your project will solve and whether your project will deliver a solution to that problem
			Identifying scope: Define the depth and breadth of the project
			Identifying deliverables: Define the product or service to provide
			Identifying project stakeholders: Figure out whom the project affects and what their needs may be
			Developing a business case: Use the above criteria to compare the potential costs and benefits for the project to determine if it moves forward
			Developing a statement of work: Document the project’s objectives, scope, and deliverables that you have identified previously as a working agreement between the project owner and those working on the project
		</p>

		<h4 class="subTopic">2. Planning</h4>
		<p>
			Once the project is approved to move forward based on your business case, statement of work, or project initiation document, you move into the planning phase.

			During this phase of the project management life cycle, you break down the larger project into smaller tasks, build your team, and prepare a schedule for the completion of assignments. Create smaller goals within the larger project, making sure each is achievable within the time frame. Smaller goals should have a high potential for success.

			Project management steps for the planning phase
			Steps for the project planning phase may include the following:

			Creating a project plan: Identify the project timeline, including the phases of the project, the tasks to be performed, and possible constraints
			Creating workflow diagrams: Visualize your processes using swimlanes to make sure team members clearly understand their role in a project
			Estimating budget and creating a financial plan: Use cost estimates to determine how much to spend on the project to get the maximum return on investment
			Gathering resources: Build your functional team from internal and external talent pools while making sure everyone has the necessary tools (software, hardware, etc.) to complete their tasks
			Anticipating risks and potential quality roadblocks: Identify issues that may cause your project to stall while planning to mitigate those risks and maintain the project’s quality and timeline
			Holding a project kickoff meeting: Bring your team on board and outline the project so they can quickly get to work
			Get started by mapping out all process steps and responsibilities in this workflow diagram template.
		</p>

		<h4 class="subTopic">3. Execution</h4>
		<p>
			You’ve received business approval, developed a plan, and built your team. Now it’s time to get to work. The execution phase turns your plan into action. The project manager’s job in this phase of the project management life cycle is to keep work on track, organize team members, manage timelines, and make sure the work is done according to the original plan.

			Project management steps for the execution phase
			Steps for the project execution phase may include the following:

			Creating tasks and organizing workflows: Assign granular aspects of the projects to the appropriate team members, making sure team members are not overworked
			Briefing team members on tasks: Explain tasks to team members, providing necessary guidance on how they should be completed, and organizing process-related training if necessary
			Communicating with team members, clients, and upper management: Provide updates to project stakeholders at all levels
			Monitoring quality of work: Ensure that team members are meeting their time and quality goals for tasks
			Managing budget: Monitor spending and keeping the project on track in terms of assets and resources
			If you have a properly documented process already in place, executing the project will be much easier.

			Depending on the project management methodology you follow, there are many visual tools that you can apply to see which deliverables have been completed ensure that your project remains on track. Use our project tracking templates to help organize your project management. Click the Kanban board and Gantt chart templates below to learn more.

		<h4 class="subTopic">4. Closure</h4>
		<p>
			Once your team has completed work on a project, you enter the closure phase. In the closure phase, you provide final deliverables, release project resources, and determine the success of the project. Just because the major project work is over, that doesn’t mean the project manager’s job is done—there are still important things to do, including evaluating what did and did not work with the project.

			Project management steps for the closure phase
			Steps for the project closure phase may include the following:

			Analyzing project performance: Determine whether the project's goals were met (tasks completed, on time and on budget) and the initial problem solved using a prepared checklist.
			Analyzing team performance: Evaluate how team members performed, including whether they met their goals along with timeliness and quality of work
			Documenting project closure: Make sure that all aspects of the project are completed with no loose ends remaining and providing reports to key stakeholders
			Conducting post-implementation reviews: Conduct a final analysis of the project, taking into account lessons learned for similar projects in the future
			Accounting for used and unused budget: Allocate remaining resources for future projects
			By remaining on task even though the project’s work is completed, you will be prepared to take everything you’ve learned and implement it for your next project.
